= The case

see link:https://docs.feelpp.org/toolboxes/latest/fsi/box/index.html[feelpp Fluid Structure Interation cases]

== Data files


=== Inspect the geometry with gmsh

You can view the geometry by running `gmsh`:

```
gmsh fsi.geo
```

== Running the case

To run the simulation on 4 nodes:

```
mpirun -np 4 feelpp_toolbox_fsi_2d --config-file fsi.cf
```

== Viewing the results

The results are stored in `/home/feelpp/feelppdb/toolboxes/fsi/movingboundary/np_4`
if you run the simulation in the devcontainer. If not, check the output of of the command to 
get the name of the basedir of the results.

To view the results, you can either run paraview or use some pyvista scripts (see notes on jupyter)
